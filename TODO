- Rename gmount to ghostfs_mount and add ghostfs_create. So ghostfs_mount will
only be responsible for mounting, and ghostfs_create only for creating files
with a given url and additional parameters such as attributes.
- Use symlink for file creation instead of using touch + setfattr, the latter
being used to set url.
- Add support to ftp protocol.
- Add support to scp protocol.
- Add support to sqlite protocol.
    - sqlite protocol will be about querying a sqlite database, and the return
    value will be available by reading the file.
    - attribute query will be used to store the query
    - we may need additional attributes such as password to access database
    content.
    - when file size is needed, we will have to perform the query, cache it
    and then return the size of the query result as the file size.
- Add support to directories.
- GhostFS isn't persistent, so let's add a config file that will contain
the file system structure. This config file will be passed to ghostfs_mount
which in turn will reconstruct the structure based on the information stored.
    Example of config file:
    { .name=/file, .url=example.com/file, .attributes = { {key, value} } }
    { .name=/dir/file2, .url=example.com/file2, .attributes = {} }
