Ghost File System or simply GhostFS

File system created to allow an user to randomly access content of a remote
file as if the file were stored locally.

Only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported at the moment, but the goal is to
add support to other protocols, such as FTP, SCP and even SQL.

GhostFS takes advantange of Linux filesystem interface to allow users to use
their existing tools on files stored in a GhostFS mount point.

FUSE and CURL are used in this project, so you will need both packages
installed when getting your hands dirty with this project.

How to use it?

1) Build the project:
    cmake .; make
2) Mount the file system:
    ./ghostfs /path/to/mount/point
3) Create an empty file:
    touch /path/to/mount/point/<file>
4) Set attribute url of the empty file using extended attribute:
    setfattr -n url -v http://<address> /path/to/mount/point/<file>

Steps 2, 3 and 4 can be done in a single step with:
    ./gmount /path/to/mount/point http://<address> <file>

And that's all. Now you can randomly access content of the remote file.

For example, let's do that with a remote video file:

1) Mount the file system:
    mkdir ./my_ghost_fs; ./ghostfs ./my_ghost_fs
2) Create a file in ./my_ghost_fs pointing to the remote video:
    touch ./my_ghost_fs/video.mp4
    setfattr -n url -v \
    http://bollywoodmp4.net/videos/2016/saala-khadoos/hq/saala-khadoos-bollywoodmp4-net.mp4 \
    ./my_ghost_fs/video.mp4

Now you can watch the video by opening ./my_ghost_fs/video.mp4

NOTE: In the future, we may replace extended attribute with symbolic link,
so step 3 and 4 (of 'How to use it?') would be replaced by:
    ln -s /path/to/mount/point/<file> http://<address>
Simpler, no?

NOTE: We also plan to add support to other protocols, such as FTP and SCP.
By the way, a protocol plugin system was recently added to GhostFS (kudos to
Pericles), so adding support to new protocols may be relatively easy.
Take a look at /protocol for a better understanding of how it works.
